## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
### What I learned

With this project i learned how to user flexboxes, and add event listeners to buttons, also i learned how to style and add animations via CSS

I learned  how to easely make a simple button animation using transform property and scale()
```css
.btn:active {
    transform: scale(0.9);
}
```
### Continued development

In the future i will attempt on adding two more modules and restyle the whole site to be fully responsive.
